E-commerce project

This was a group project assigned to us, to be completed within a week. 

The goal was to simulate an e-commerce website using a simulated database. The database was a local json file which was not updated when a user
purchased an item. The information was updated solely during the server's iteration and reset upon relaunch. 

I personally handled the backend side of the project while my team mates dealt with the frontend side of it. Once the backend was complete I 
helped complete a few things in the frontend and did major code cleanup/review in the backend and frontend.

The project allows users to login (although logging in does not grant access to any feature other than the profile page). The user's profile 
page is just a placeholder. Users can search by item name, type, or category. The results of the search will be displayed and can be filtered 
based on the selection of items on the left. 

The navbar features a dropdown that allows users to quickly display items by category as well. If an item is out of stock, the user can choose
to display items that are similar. The flavor text for the items is dynamically rendered based on their pricing. 

Clicking on the name of the company displayed on the product detail card will show all the products being sold by the company. 

Users can add any items to their cart, in amounts ranging from 1 to the maximum in stock. Once the purchase is confirmed, a randomly generated
order confirmation number will appear which can be used to pull up the details under the order history tab.
